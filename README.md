# Clcling Lane Quality Detection

The aim of this assignment is to develop a tool that can automatically determine the condition of cycling lanes â€” whether they are smooth or bumpy.

## Project Structure

### ðŸ“‚ Data_Processing
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Applying fundamental techniques to clean and preprocess the collected data, ensuring it is in a suitable format for analysis.  
- **Preparation for Analysis**  
  Merging datasets, performing feature extraction, and structuring the preprocessed data into a well-organized DataFrame, ready for later analysis.  

### ðŸ“‚ Data_Analysis
- **Data Analysis**  
  Clustering cycling lane data using different algorithms: K-means, Fuzzy C-means, and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).  
- **Model Training**  
  A GMM model was trained on the cycling data and used to determine the surface quality of a route in Tilburg.
